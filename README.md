# Iancu Victor - Iuliu - Portfolio Website

Here is the link to the deployed website:
https://iancuvictor.github.io/Portfolio/

In case you want to start it on your localhost (for some unknown reason), here are the steps you should follow:

1. Download the whole project by cloning the main folder.

2. Open a terminal inside the "Portfolio" folder where the package.json and package-lock.json files are located.
<br><sub>*You can also use Visual Studio Code, which I recommend since it has a built in Terminal*</sub>

3. Run ```npm install``` to install all the necessary dependencies.

4. run ```npm start```.

Also, some previews of the website:
