# Iancu Victor - Iuliu - Portfolio Website

This project has the purpose of showing off my frontend skills, while also serving as a portfolio website.<br>I know nobody actually cares about the portfolio part =)

<br>**This project was made in:**
- **HTML**
- **Css**
- **Js**
- **React.js** 

### NOTE that this website is NOT finished yet. I'm open to critique, and, in fact, if you think that I could improve either the looks, or the code itself in any way, feel free to leave a comment! Much appreciated!

Here is the preview of the website:

Also, since I am too poor and I do not really want to host it, I'll give you a guide on how to view it in *your* browser. (hopefully chrome)

1. Download the whole project by cloning the main folder.

2. Open a terminal inside the "Portfolio" folder where the package.json and package-lock.json files are located.
<br><sub>*You can also use Visual Studio Code, which I recommend since it has a built in Terminal*</sub>

3. Run ```npm install``` to install all the necessary dependencies.

4. run ```npm start```.

And that's kind of it. Hopefully your feedback on this project (if there is any) will be positive!
